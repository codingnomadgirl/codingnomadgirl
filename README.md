- 👋 Hi, I’m @codingnomadgirl aka Gia, aspiring Python developer in training by day, salsa dancer by night. 

- ✈️  I have been travelling around the world for the last 10 years running an online business. I've lived in the US, the UK, China and short visits in over 30 countries.

- 🌱 I’m currently looking for internships/junior level positions in Python and/or Data Analytics. 

- 💞️ Personally, I’m looking for accountability buddies to work on projects and uplevelling in Python.

- I've just moved to 7kyu on Codewars!
